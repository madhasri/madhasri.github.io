### Political Bias Estimation

![Graph](imgs/dp.png)

Most of the News and Media organizations in the world have some direct or indirect political affiliations, hence the content generated by these organizations is biased towards the respective ideologies of the political parties that the news organization is affiliated with.We aim to find the political leanings of few of the leading newspapers in India. This holds relevance as India is the world’s largest democracy with more than 1700 political parties and also the largest market for newspapers in the world with over 100 million copies sold every day. A framework has been proposed integrating a Social graph approach and Natural Language Processing (Machine Learning) approach to identify and estimate bias in the Indian context. Further a case study has been performed analyzing Twitter Data of Indian News Organizations.

### Twitter Trending Topic Classification

In the era of Social Networking, tweeting is the newest trend. About 200 million tweets are being generated every day. Twitter provides a list of the most trending topics; it is often hard to understand what these topics are about. This project is to classify a set of tweets T1,T2,T3,...,Tn into general categories like Sports, Business, Entertainment, Technology, Food and Lifestyle and others. Each tweet can belong to more than one category.
